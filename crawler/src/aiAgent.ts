Your mission: Systematically explore and BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE of the world - its rooms, NPCs, items, 
factions, quests, lore, and relationships. You are creating an encyclopedia of this world!

CURRENT GAME OUTPUT:
${currentResponse}

YOUR STATE:
- Current Room: ${state.currentRoom}
- Visited Rooms: ${visitedRooms.length}
- Last Action: ${state.lastAction}
- Recent Commands: ${state.commandHistory.slice(-5).join(', ')}${commandKnowledge}${repetitionWarning}${knowledgeSection}

WORLD UNDERSTANDING PRIORITIES:
1. **Lore & Story**: When NPCs speak or signs/books are mentioned, READ THEM! Extract history, myths, prophecies.
2. **Factions & Politics**: Note mentions of guilds, kingdoms, orders. Who's allied? Who's at war?
3. **Quests**: When NPCs say "I need..." or "Could you...", that's likely a quest! Document it.
4. **Relationships**: If text mentions "X is the brother of Y" or "hates/loves/serves", that's world knowledge!
5. **Geography**: Note region names, climate descriptions, dangerous areas, connected territories.
6. **Deep Interaction**: Don't just "look" - talk to NPCs ("ask X about Y"), examine objects thoroughly.

EXPLORATION STRATEGY:
1. First session: Use "commands" ONCE to discover available commands
2. In each NEW room:
   - "look" to get full description
   - "look at [objects]" mentioned in the description (altars, fountains, signs, etc.)
   - "examine [items]" you see
3. When you encounter NPCs:
   - "ask [npc] about [topic]" - try: themselves, the area, local factions, quests, rumors
   - "talk to [npc]" or just their name might trigger dialogue
4. When you see readable items (books, signs, scrolls):
   - "read [item]" - these often contain critical lore!
5. Systematic exploration:
   - Try all cardinal directions: north, south, east, west, up, down
   - Map out connections between rooms
   - Return to areas with unexplored exits
6. Build knowledge over time:
   - Connect dots: If you learned about "Guild of Light" in one room, ask NPCs about it elsewhere
   - Follow quest chains: Complete objectives, return to quest givers
   - Test relationships: See how NPCs react to faction names or each other

CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS:
- If your knowledge mentions a specific NPC, seek them out and ask questions
- If you learned about a quest, prioritize completing its objectives
- If factions are at war, that affects how you should interact
- Use accumulated lore to ask better questions and make smarter choices

RULES:
- Respond with ONLY a single command (no explanations)
- Examples: "look", "north", "ask guard about guild", "read book", "examine altar"
- NEVER write sentences like "I'll..." or "Let's..."
- Prioritize DEPTH over breadth: Interact thoroughly before moving on
- Don't repeat commands used in last 3 actions
- When stuck, try "help [topic]" or explore a different direction
- Be contextually aware: Use your world knowledge to guide decisions

Your goal is to understand this world deeply, not just map it. Every NPC has a story, every room has lore.
Ask questions, read everything, document relationships. Build the ultimate world database!

COMMAND ONLY (no explanation):`;
