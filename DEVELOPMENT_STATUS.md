## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Complete TypeScript Migration ⭐ NEW!
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (October 30, 2025)

**Backend Fully Migrated**:
- ✅ All JavaScript files converted to TypeScript
- ✅ `seed.js` → `seed.ts` (1,883 lines, fully restored from git)
- ✅ `genericRoutes.js` → `genericRoutes.ts` with proper type annotations
- ✅ `database.ts`, `routes.ts`, `index.ts` already TypeScript
- ✅ Build scripts configured in package.json:
  - `npm run build` - Compiles TypeScript to dist/
  - `npm run dev` - Runs with tsx watch for hot reload
  - `npm start` - Runs compiled production build
  - `npm run seed` - Seeds database with comprehensive data
  - `npm run db:reset` - Drops DB and re-seeds
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful with no errors
- ✅ All type annotations added for database callbacks
- ✅ Proper error handling with typed error objects

**Database Path Consistency**:
- ✅ Unified database location: `mud-data.db` in project root
- ✅ Both seed.ts and database.ts use `path.resolve(__dirname, '../mud-data.db')`
- ✅ No more mud_data.db vs mud-data.db confusion
- ✅ No more backend/ vs root directory conflicts

**Migration Benefits**:
- Better type safety and IDE autocomplete
- Easier refactoring and maintenance
- Catches errors at compile time
- Foundation for future architecture improvements

### 4. Logging System
- **Timestamped Logs**: `combined-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.log` format
- **Winston Logger**: Configured with filters and formatters
- **Telnet Communication Logging**: 
  - `📤 SENDING to telnet: "command"` - Commands sent
  - `📥 RECEIVED from telnet: \n<response>` - Full telnet responses
- **Log Archiver**: Automatically moves logs >30 minutes old to `logs/archive/`
  - Runs on 60-second interval
  - Integrated into crawler lifecycle (starts/stops with crawler)
- **Correct Directory**: Logs saved to `crawler/logs/`

### 4. Logging System
- **Conditional Login Detection**: 
  - Checks buffer for "press enter" prompt (only appears after long logout)
  - Checks for game menu "make your choice"
  - Sends responses only when needed
- **Character Selection**: Automatically selects character #1 from menu

### 5. Smart Login System
- **API-Level Suppression**: `logBackendError()` method in `api.ts`
- **Smart Tracking**: `backendAvailable` flag tracks state
- **Rate Limiting**: Shows warning once, then silently fails for 5 minutes
- **Applied to All Methods**: saveRoom, saveNPC, saveItem, saveSpell, updateCrawlerStatus

### 6. Backend Error Handling

- **AI Prompt Integration**: Commands formatted as "command (✓success/✗fail)"

### 7. Command Knowledge Tracking
- **Environment Variable**: `SINGLE_TASK_MODE=true` in `crawler/.env`
- **Purpose**: AI makes ONE decision per run, then exits cleanly
- **Use Case**: Training/testing without continuous operation
- **Status**: ✅ Fully working

### 8. Single-Task Mode
- **Persistent Knowledge Base**: `ai-knowledge.md` file stores learning across sessions
- **Auto-Loading**: Loads at startup and includes in every AI decision
- **Periodic Updates**: AI updates knowledge every 50 actions
- **Session Summary**: Final knowledge update at session end
- **Knowledge Sections**:
  - Priority Commands to Try First
  - Available Game Commands (from "commands" output)
  - Discovered Commands (with success/failure stats)
  - Command Test Results (organized by category)
  - Map & Navigation (rooms and connections)
  - NPCs & Interactions
  - Items & Equipment
  - Combat & Mechanics
  - Lessons Learned
- **AI-Friendly Format**: Markdown format easy for LLM to read/write
- **Growing Intelligence**: AI builds institutional knowledge over time

### 9. AI Knowledge Management System
- **"commands" Output Capture**: Detects and parses full command list from game
- **Automatic Help Lookup**: Queues discovered commands for "help <command>" documentation
- **Database Integration**: 
  - Commands table with syntax, description, category
  - Test results tracked (input, output, success/failure, timestamp)
  - Usage statistics (count, last used)
- **Help Documentation Parser**:
  - Extracts syntax and description from "help <command>" output
  - Stores in database and knowledge base
  - Handles "no help available" gracefully
- **Command Categorization**: navigation, combat, info, inventory, social, etc.
- **Smart Injection**: Periodically injects "help" commands (20% chance when queue has items)
- **Persistent Learning**: Commands and their docs persist across sessions

### 10. Command Learning & Documentation System
- **Aggressive Loop Prevention**: Blocks commands used even ONCE in last 3 actions
- **Smart Fallback Commands**: Context-aware alternatives when repetition detected
- **Command Cleaning**: Strips explanatory text from AI responses
  - Removes "I'll...", "Let's...", sentence starters
  - Extracts commands from quotes
  - Handles multi-word commands properly
- **Prevents Stuck Loops**: No more endless "commands" repetition
- **Logged Warnings**: `⚠️ AI chose "X" but it was used N time(s) - forcing different action`

## 📊 Database Architecture

### Schema Overview
The database uses SQLite with 21 tables organized into logical groups:

#### Game Mechanics (10 tables)
- `abilities`, `ability_scores` - Character stats and their effects
- `races` - 17 playable races
- `saving_throws` - 5 save types
- `spell_modifiers` - 17 damage/effect modifiers
- `elemental_resistances` - 13 elemental types
- `physical_resistances` - 4 physical damage types
- `skills` - Learnable skills

#### Character Classes (5 tables)
- `class_groups` → `classes` → `class_proficiencies`
- `class_perks` ← `class_perk_availability` → `classes`
- Full progression system with prerequisites and level requirements

#### World Geography (3 tables)
- `zones` (74 zones) → `zone_areas` (~150 areas) 
- `zone_connections` (many-to-many, ~250 connections)

#### Navigation & Exploration (2 tables)
- `rooms` (zone_id FK, terrain, flags, visit tracking)
- `room_exits` (from_room_id, to_room_id, direction, door properties)
- Supports unidirectional and bidirectional connections

#### Dynamic Content (6 tables)
- `player_actions` - Unified table for commands, socials, emotes (replaces commands table)
  - Type classification: command, social, emote, spell, skill, other
  - Full help text in description field
  - Usage tracking: timesUsed, successCount, failCount
  - Discovery metadata: documented, discovered, lastTested
  - Syntax, examples, requirements, levelRequired, relatedActions
- `npcs`, `items`, `spells`, `attacks` - Game entities
- `command_usage` - Command execution log
- `exploration_queue` - Planned actions
- `crawler_status` - Crawler state tracking

### Data Population Status
- ✅ **Classes**: 14 classes fully seeded with 93 proficiencies
- ✅ **Zones**: All 74 zones with areas and connections
- ✅ **Rooms**: 5 sample Midgaard rooms with 17 exits
- ✅ **Player Actions**: 3 sample actions (who, look, hug) with full help text
- ⏳ **More Actions**: Populated by crawler as discovered (200+ commands, 300+ socials)
- ⏳ **NPCs/Items/Spells**: Populated by crawler during exploration

## ⚠️ Current Issues (In Progress)
**Problem**: AI sometimes gets stuck repeating same command (e.g., "commands" loop)
- **Mitigation Applied**:
  - Aggressive repetition blocking (blocks if used ONCE in last 3 actions)
  - Context-aware fallback commands
  - Command cleaning to extract just the command
  - Warning logs when forced to fallback
- **Current Status**: Improved significantly, monitoring effectiveness
- **Next Steps**: May need to tune fallback logic or add cooldown periods

### ✅ RESOLVED: Issue #1: Ollama Model Name Mismatch 
**Problem**: Code requested `llama3.2` but Ollama has `llama3.2:3b` installed
- **Error**: `{"error":"model 'llama3.2' not found"}` (HTTP 404)
- **Locations Fixed**: 
  - `crawler/src/aiAgent.ts` line 18 - default parameter
  - `crawler/src/index.ts` line 33 - fallback default value
- **Fix Applied**: Changed both occurrences from `'llama3.2'` to `'llama3.2:3b'`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Rebuilt and tested successfully

### ✅ RESOLVED: Issue #2: .env Configuration Not Loading
**Problem**: Environment variables not being read from .env file
- **Root Cause #1**: Conflicting root `.env` file vs `crawler/.env` file
- **Root Cause #2**: Wrong path in `dotenv.config()` - was looking for `../../.env` (root) instead of `../../../.env` (crawler)
- **Symptoms**: `SINGLE_TASK_MODE` showed as `undefined`, model name fell back to default
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Deleted redundant root `.env` file
  - Updated `crawler/src/index.ts` line 12: Changed path from `../../.env` to `../../../.env`
  - Ensured `crawler/.env` has `SINGLE_TASK_MODE=true`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Environment variables now load correctly

### ✅ RESOLVED: Issue #3: Log Files in Wrong Directory
**Problem**: Logs created in root `logs/` instead of `crawler/logs/`
- **Root Cause**: Logger path `__dirname, '../../logs'` resolved to wrong location due to nested dist structure
- **Fix Applied**: Changed `crawler/src/logger.ts` line 4 from `../../logs` to `../../../logs`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Logs now correctly created in `crawler/logs/`

### ✅ RESOLVED: Issue #4: Single-Task Mode Working Correctly
**Problem**: Initially appeared not to work, but was due to .env not loading (see Issue #2)
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Works perfectly once .env loads correctly

   # Terminal 3 - Crawler (optional)
   cd "c:\work\other\Apocalypse VI MUD\crawler"
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test Admin Panel**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - Browse zones, click to see details
   - View rooms in each zone
   - Click rooms to see full details with exits
   - Navigate between rooms via exit links
   - **NEW**: Browse Player Actions, click to see full help text and statistics
   - Test CRUD operations on classes, perks, zones

3. **Monitor Crawler Integration**:
   - Crawler will populate rooms table as it explores
   - Room exits will be created for discovered connections
   - **NEW**: Player actions will be documented as discovered (commands/socials/emotes)
   - **NEW**: Crawler will execute `help <action>` and store full text in description
   - View real-time data in admin panel

### Immediate Next Priorities

1. **Crawler Action Discovery**:
   - Parse `commands` output to get all available commands
   - Parse `social` output to get all social actions
   - Execute `help <action>` for each discovered action
   - Store full help text in player_actions.description field
   - Auto-detect action type (command vs social vs emote)
   - Track usage statistics during exploration

2. **Crawler Room Discovery**:
   - Implement room parsing to extract name, description, terrain
   - Auto-create room records in database
   - Parse exits and create room_exit records
   - Associate rooms with zones based on area names

2. **NPC & Item Discovery**:
   - Parse room descriptions for NPCs and items
   - Create NPC records with location tracking
   - Create item records with properties
   - Link to rooms for location-based queries

3. **Map Visualization** (Future Enhancement):
   - Generate visual map from room_exits data
   - Show zone boundaries and connections
   - Display current crawler location
   - Interactive navigation

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- **AI Prompt Optimization**: Include command knowledge in AI prompt
- **Parser Improvements**: Better detection of combat, errors, item pickups
- **Command Success Detection**: More sophisticated pattern matching
- **Log Rotation**: Implement max log file size limits

### Long Term
- **Multi-Session Learning**: AI remembers lessons across runs
- **Map Building**: Track room connections and create visual map
- **Quest Detection**: Identify and track quest objectives
- **Combat Strategy**: Learn effective combat patterns
- **Item Management**: Smart inventory management
- **NPC Interaction**: Learn dialogue options and outcomes

## 🐛 Known Quirks

1. **Winston Logger Filter**: `filterBackendErrors()` in `logger.ts` doesn't fully suppress backend errors - API-level suppression works better
2. **Nested Dist Output**: Build creates `dist/crawler/src/` structure due to shared types inclusion
3. **Log Archiver Timing**: 30-minute threshold is hardcoded, could be configurable
4. **MUD Login Timing**: Conditional login detection works but adds ~5 second delay on startup
